<h3 align="center">NLP: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS</h3>

- - -
> Reviews on a product, service, movie or texts about persons or events (political, social, etc.), are very important to get a clear picture of what the end users/general public think, namely, to understand what the reasons (key aspects/features) are for being satisfied or not with the purchase of a product or service, the reasons for liking or disliking a given movie or person, and so on. 
>
> **Sentiment analysis can help us gather insightful information regarding reviews/texts by deciphering what people like/dislike, what they want and what their major concerns are**.<br>

>There are mainly two approaches to extract the sentiment from given reviews/texts and classify the result as positive or negative: 
>- Lexicon Based Approach 
>- Machine Learning Approach  

â†’ In the **notebooks** of this **repo** we will address the **machine learning approach**
